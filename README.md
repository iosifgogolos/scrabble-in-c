# scrabble-in-c
The game 'Scrabble' written in C. Download the README file for more information about the implementation on Mac.

Scrabble is a game where players (in this game 2 players) form words and let them compete to with other. Each alphabetic letter has a value of points assigned to it. Common letters, like A and E and I are only worth 1 point, while slightly less common letters like B or C or M are worth 3 points.
Rare letters like Q, and Z are worth even more points: 10 points in this case.

The official Score table, which is mapped to an array in the program is listed below: 

A = 1 point
B = 3 points
C = 3 points
D = 2 points
E = 1 point
F = 4 points
G = 2 points
H = 4 points
I = 1 point
J = 8 points
K = 5 points
L = 1 points
M = 3 points
N = 1 point

R = 1 point
S = 1 point
T = 1 point
U = 1 point
V = 4 points
W = 4 points
X = 8 points
